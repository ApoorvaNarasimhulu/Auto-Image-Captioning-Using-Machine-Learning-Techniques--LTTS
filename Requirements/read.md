# Introduction
•	Significantly analyzing visual defectiveness people represents more of the population around the world roughly speaking more than 10 million. Their incorporation in the public is an essential point. In order to give Audible environment for the blind people this project mainly concentrates on the field of Assistive devices for Visually Impairment Persons.

•	The basic idea for our proposed method is to design Auto-Assistance system for visually impaired person.

•	Model is skilled in a way that if input is given it starts generating the Sentences about the Image. Experiments show that it is often generating exact descriptions for image. A new dataset has been collected in real time which consists of pot holes, people and Vehicles.

•	People start communicating with Each other via a Mediator called Language, whether it is written or oral. They make use of this with the objective of illustrating the world which is around them. For Physically Challenged people, Images, symbols and Signs are the way of Communication. Generating Automatic Sentences from image is a bit tricky task, but it has an immense impact on Visually Impaired Persons and it can help them better understanding the Environment and Situations.

•	While the Visually Challenged person is travelling irrespective of any Environment, The Main Aspire of Assisting Technology is to notice objects, recognize it, and then produce voice alert. The system is proposed in order to guide the blind people about the objects and obstacles that are present near them. The Images of the object can be downloaded from any source (or) it can be captured at live. Images are classified based on class label and it is called Localization of object.

# Research
  •	With the enormous growth of Artificial Intelligence, Researches slowly paying attention towards Image Caption and it starts becoming an Interesting job. It combines the information of both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing in order to automatically generate NL sentences according to the content in image.
  
  •	This helps the blind people to “observe” the world. In recent times attention has been increased and mainly becoming vital role in computer vision. “Before, these methods use to collect information in the image using motionless entity object and model it by using Statistical Language models”.
# Cost and Features
 
 Cost:
 
•	Since the system uses open source software. It is free of cost!

Features:

•	Model takes Input as the images whether it is downloaded or captured by webcam. This Input Images are given to a model, and then model starts analyzing the image and produces captions according to it. This process continues till the user clear’s it”

•	This model gives lot of benefit for visually impaired people which makes their life so comfortable and Independent.

# 4 W'S and 1'H

  4 W'S:
  
  Who: It helps for Visually Impaired people to view the environment independently.

  What: Model converts contents of the image into an Audible Format within few seconds.
  
  When: When visually impaired people are struggling to walk on the road.
  
  Where: It can be used anywhere.
  
  1’H:
  
  How: 
  After successful running, GUI gets open and you can choose to give a picture or video either preloaded or from camera .Then it starts generating output in audible form according to the content observed in the image.

# Functional and Non Functional Requirements

  Functional:
  
•	 Device must be enabled or disabled by user.

•	 Device should be able to capture image on mounted camera

•	 It should be able to convert received text data to speech. 

•	 GUI should stream live image feed without severely lagging.

•	 GUI should display output without lagging and the device should produce correct output.

•	Device should be enabled or disabled by user at any time.

Non Functional:

•	System should work real-time which means there should be a acceptable time delay such as max 4-5 seconds between request and response. 

•	The system shall allow the system administrator to add additional features. The system needs to be cost-effective to maintain.
